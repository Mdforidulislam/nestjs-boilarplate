=================================  Stripe OnBaording System Connect with Business Modal ========================

Marketplace : should be include Here‚Äôs



Yes ‚Äî ‚úÖ you got it exactly right.
Let me now confirm and refine your flow so you can implement it confidently.

üß© FULL FLOW ‚Äî Marketplace with Stripe Connect + Subscriptions
Here‚Äôs how it works step-by-step in your app:

‚úÖ 1. User Registers in Your App
Fill in name, email, password

Stored in your DB

‚úÖ 2. Create Stripe Connect (Express) Account
When user registers or visits onboarding:

ts
Copy
Edit
const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
  type: 'express',
  email: user.email,
});
Store account.id in your database (acct_...)

‚úÖ 3. Redirect to Onboarding (KYC + Bank Info)
Generate onboarding link:

ts
Copy
Edit
const link = await stripe.accountLinks.create({
  account: account.id,
  type: 'account_onboarding',
  refresh_url: '<your-site>/retry',
  return_url: '<your-site>/done',
});
‚û°Ô∏è User submits:

National ID / Passport

Bank account info

Personal address, DOB

‚úÖ Stripe handles KYC, security, compliance.

‚úÖ 4. Stripe Verifies the User
Stripe checks the info:

‚úÖ If passed ‚Üí account is charges_enabled = true & payouts_enabled = true

‚ùå If failed ‚Üí Stripe asks them to re-submit

You should check status before allowing payouts.

‚úÖ 5. User Subscribes to Your Platform (if required)
If users must have a subscription to work:

Create a Stripe Checkout Session for subscription

ts
Copy
Edit
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  mode: 'subscription',
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  line_items: [{ price: 'price_xxx', quantity: 1 }],
  customer_email: user.email,
  success_url: '<your-site>/success',
  cancel_url: '<your-site>/cancel',
});
‚û°Ô∏è Redirect them to session.url

‚úÖ They pay using Card only, as required

‚úÖ 6. User Can Start Tasking
After subscription is active:

User can accept/post/complete tasks

Your app keeps track of task status

‚úÖ 7. Customer Pays for Task ‚Üí Platform Charges
You (platform) collect money when:

Task is started, OR

Task is completed

Use destination charge so money is sent to the freelancer:

ts
Copy
Edit
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 5000,
  currency: 'usd',
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
  application_fee_amount: 500, // your platform fee
  transfer_data: {
    destination: 'acct_1234...', // freelancer's account
  },
});
‚úÖ Stripe splits payment: freelancer gets their share, you keep fee.

‚úÖ 8. User Gets Paid to Their Bank (via Stripe)
Stripe pays the freelancer automatically:

Bank info was added earlier during onboarding

They don‚Äôt need to do anything

Money arrives in bank in 2‚Äì5 days

‚úÖ 9. (Optional) Freelancer Can View Their Stripe Express Dashboard
If you want to let them see balance, payout schedule:

ts
Copy
Edit
const loginLink = await stripe.accounts.createLoginLink('acct_1234...');
‚û°Ô∏è You can show a "View Stripe Dashboard" button
‚û°Ô∏è Or show Withdraw button in your app and link them

‚ùó But they don‚Äôt need this to get paid ‚Äî it's optional

‚úÖ Final User Experience Summary
Step	What User Does	What You Do
Register	‚úÖ Enters name, email	‚úÖ Save user
Onboarding	‚úÖ Provide ID, Bank info	‚úÖ Create Connect account + link
Wait	‚è≥ Stripe verifies	‚úÖ Poll or webhook account.updated
Subscribe	‚úÖ Pay with card	‚úÖ Create Checkout session
Task	‚úÖ Work	‚úÖ Track task
Get paid	‚úÖ See "Withdraw" or Stripe Dashboard	‚úÖ Charge customer, split payment
Payout	‚úÖ Money goes to their bank	‚úÖ All via Stripe automatically

‚úÖ All Controls Are in Your App
You decide when to let them work

You decide when to pay them

You control subscriptions

You provide optional Stripe dashboard link

Stripe does:

KYC

Secure bank transfer

Legal compliance

Let me know if you want:
‚úÖ Sample backend code (NestJS/Express)

‚úÖ Stripe webhook setup

‚úÖ UI flow (user side)

‚úÖ Role management system (customer vs freelancer)

You're 90% there ‚Äî now it's about coding the logic into your app!
